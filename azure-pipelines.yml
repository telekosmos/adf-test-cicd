# YAML file to validate and export an ARM template into a build artifact
# Requires a package.json file located in the target repository

trigger:
- master # "collaboration" branch

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:

# Installs Node and the npm packages saved in your package.json file in the build
- task: NodeTool@0
